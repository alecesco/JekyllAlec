John Stamos was born on August 19, 1963 in Cypress, California to William "Bill" Stamos, a restaurateur, and Loretta (née Phillips)[3]. His father was of Greek descent, and his mother was of English and Irish ancestry. He has two sisters, Alana and Janeen.

John's paternal grandmother, Adeline Psaras, was born in the United States to Greek immigrants; his paternal grandfather, Ioannis Stamatopoulos, came from the village of Kakouri in the Peloponnese region of Greece and changed the family surname from "Stamatopoulos" to "Stamos" upon arriving in the United States. Ioannis's father, Vasilios Stamatopoulos, was murdered in Kakouri in 1905 by a gunshot wound to the head during a feud with a man named Ioannis Koliopoulos.[citation needed] On an episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, Stamos traveled to Greece and discovered from a relative, Kostoula Stamatopoulos, that he and his grandfather were named after Vasilios's killer (Ioannis being the Greek equivalent of John).

In his youth, Stamos worked for his father's restaurants, and as a teenager had a job flipping burgers in the Orange County area. He attended John F. Kennedy High School and played in the marching band there. At 15, he attended his first Beach Boys concert; a huge fan, he would later tour with the band. His parents were supportive of his aspiration to be an actor, and although he planned to enroll at Cypress College for the 1981 term, he skipped his first semester to focus on launching a career as an actor—with his father's blessing. After just three weeks, he landed his first role on General Hospital.[4]
